# Personal Portfolio
## Overview
This is a personal portfolio that showcases Jacqueline Lam's projects, software engineering journey, blog posts and more.

The app is composed of backend rails API and front-end React Redux clients, which use asynchronous Javascript (with the help of redux-thunk middleware) to make HTTP requests to the API and render them to the user interface.
