# React Redux Project - Personal Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio that showcases Jacqueline Lam's projects, software engineering journey, blog posts and more.

The app is composed of backend rails API and front-end React Redux clients, which use asynchronous Javascript (with the help of redux-thunk middleware) to make HTTP requests to the API and render them to the user interface.

## Installation

Download zip from my project repository: https://github.com/jacqueline-lam/portfolio

Go to your terminal and change directory:

    $ cd portfolio

If you don't have Ruby, please install Ruby version `ruby 2.6.1`.

 With Rubygems loaded, you can install all of Rails and its dependencies using the following command through the command line:

    $ gem install rails -v 6.0.3

Use the following command to make Rails executable available.

    $ rbenv rehash

More installation instructions can be found on the [Ruby on Rails Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html#installing-rails)

Once Ruby and Rails are installed, `cd` into `portfolio-api` and run:

    $ gem install bundler


Bundler gem provides us access to a terminal command: `bundle install`

Install the gems and gem dependencies for this app by running:

    $ bundle install

And then run:

    $ rails db:seed

And then run:

    $ rails s

Lastly, open another tab and `cd` into `portfolio-frontend`, then run:
    $ npm install && npm start
to browse the application in your browser at your localhost.
